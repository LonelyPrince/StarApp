    service description
  * Changed cg_upnp_controlpoint_expirationhandler() to use

clinkc (1.0-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes from 2006-01-09 to 2006-01-16
  * Added HTTP-header parsing for curl
  * Added state variable updating thru events
  * Added NULL checks to cg_strcasecmp, cg_streq, cg_strcaseeq and cg_strtrim
  * Changed event key to unsigned int instead of long to better fulfill 
    specifications
  * Added API comments to csubscriber.[c|h]
  * Added API comments to ceventlistener_list.c
  * Fixed a typo: cg_http_request_isnotiryrequest ->
    cg_http_request_isnotifyrequest
  * Fixed a typo: cg_upnp_controlpoint_httprequestrecieved ->
    cg_upnp_controlpoint_httprequestreceived
  * Added device type parsing functions:
    cg_upnp_devicetype_getidentifier, _geturn, _getdevice,_gettype and
    _getversion
  * Added cg_upnp_device_getdevicebytype(),
          cg_upnp_device_getdevicebyexacttype(),
          cg_upnp_controlpoint_getdevicebytype() and
          cg_upnp_controlpoint_getdevicebyexacttype()
    to enable searching for devices with/without version information.
  * Removed *_getdevicebyname() and *_device_isname() functions because
    UPnP specs don't specify UDN, type nor friendly name as being the
    device's "name" attribute.
  * Added cg_upnp_controlpoint_getdevicebyudn() and
    cg_upnp_device_getdevicebyudn() functions to make up for the loss
    of *_getdevicebyname()
  * Removed *_getservicebyname() and *_service_isname() functions and
    changed them to *_getservicebyexacttype in tests & samples.
  * Removed the automatic search from cg_upnp_controlpoint_start().
  * Renamed cg_upnp_device_getservicebyname to
    cg_upnp_device_getservicebyexacttype
  * Added cg_upnp_servicetype_getschematype()
  * Fixed existing cg_upnp_servicetype_ functions to accept
    1-character strings as well.
  * Added service type parsing functions:
    cg_upnp_servicetype_getidentifier, _geturn, _getservice,_gettype and
    _getversion
  * Added cg_upnp_device_getservicebytype() to enable searching for
    services without version information.
